# Espresso
Espresso is a general purpose programming language that closely resembles Java. It is strogly typed, object-oriented and has support for basic Lambda expressions. 

## Compiler
This repository also stores the source for a compiler written in Ocaml. The compiler translates espresso programs into LLVM. The compiler performs semantic validations and generates LLVM instructions without any optimizations.

This project was done for the course Programming Languages and Translators (PLT)
